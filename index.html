          <h1>Hello, Welcome!</h1>
          <p class="lead">I'm a Front-End Developer for Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, INDIA.
            I have serious passion for UI effects, animations and creating intuitive, dynamic user experiences.</p>
          <p>My name is Sumant Mishra. I was born and brought up in Gorakhpur. However, I presently put up in Allahabad. I have a total work experience of 6 months which I have gained at Vinayak Associates and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and my last drawn salary is 4 Lakh(s) 5 Thousand per annum. My highest degree is a full time B.Tech/B.E. in Computers from Kamla Nehru Institute of Technology, Sultanpur that I completed in May-2022. My GPA out of 10 is 8.7 and I am among Top 3 in class. My Computers degree(s) has given a range of skills that I feel are crucial for my career and life. Despite limited exposure, I have understood that hard work and determination can make anything possible. I am ready to do that. Also, I am trying to develop a habit of reading current trends and industry news. I interned with Rural Engineering Department Jhansi PWD, IIIT ALLAHABAD and BSNL for 9 Month(s) in total and contributed to the Technical Intern, Machine learning and Network Administration Packeting. My project work(s) lasted for 2 Month(s) in total as I worked on Heart Disease prediction Using Machine learning. I would like to add that I am certified in 06 Month(s) Certificate In Computer Programming (CCP), 06 Month(s) Ncc State level sports NIELIT 4 Week Certified course on C Programming . and 06 Month(s) Certificate Course in Basic Programming. When it comes to schooling, I secured 78.0% in my XIIth Other Senior Secondary examination in 2017. In Xth CBSE Board, I got 72.0%. During my schooling, I developed strong communication skills and also had the opportunity to participate and excel in several extracurricular activities. Because of these exposures and experiences during my academic years, I have gradually been able to develop effective communication skills. So, I can interact freely within a team. To add, I am also skilled in Software Testing, Software Quality Assurance, HTML, C, C++, SQL, CSS, MongoDB and Javascript. Additionally, I am an AIEEE Rank 501 holder. Lastly, I am a quick learner and believe in learning from my past mistakes. This is a virtue as it can take me ahead in both my professional and personal life.</p>
